1. javascript only - try to fetch <video> tag and get its src, if its "blob" (encrypted spoffed media - it will not work)

2. client or server - read the html page, locate in the source: ytplayer.config
   convert it to JSON object.
   then you can look for 
      ytplayer.config.args.adaptive_fmts
      ytplayer.config.args.url_encoded_fmt_stream_map
      split and decode ->  "," -> "&" -> "="
      
3. using (2) get the string from "ytplayer.config.args.dashmpd" its called the of dash-manifest (xml) -  and parse it to fetch all video sources (even video-only and audio-only sources).
